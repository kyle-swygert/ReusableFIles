this is the README file for reusable_files repository.
as many of the data structures as possible should be templated to hold all data types. 

data structures to be included:

BST
AVL Tree with the base tree being the BST class
Doubly Linked List (possibly) 
red-black tree
Heap data structure
Hash Table

also include sorting algorithms after sata structures have been added. 


try to make a generic node type object that can be used in many different types of data structures
the node will hold a templated data type, as well as a vector of node pointers. This is so as many nodes
as necessary can be added to make many different types of data structures.
